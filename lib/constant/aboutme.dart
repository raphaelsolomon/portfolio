const AboutMe = 'My name is Uzoechi Chigozie Raphael and I am a Mobile Application Developer, currently living in Nigeria, NG. I have a National Diploma and a Higher National Diploma in Computer Science from Moshood Abiola Polythenic, Completed Project Management Professional with Alpha Consulting Services, and my primary focus and inspiration is Mobile/Backend Development. In my free time, I study Penetration Testing. I am both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about Mobile Development and Backend Development, and strive to better the development community as a whole. I develop in both Java(native), swift(native) and Dart, though I primarily use Dart (Flutter). I am experienced in both front and backend Mobile development, and I am proficient in NodeJS, MySQL, to name a few. I have also worked on some personal and commercial projects(fintech, education, health and lifestyle), and have used these languages consecutively for all developments.';
